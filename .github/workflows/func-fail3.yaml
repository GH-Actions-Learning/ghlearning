# 🧠 Key Rules to Keep in Mind:
#
# ✅ GitHub Actions aborts a job after a step fails — unless the next step has:
#    if: condition (e.g. failure() or always())
#    or the failed step used continue-on-error: true
#
# ✅ Once a step fails, the job enters a "failure state"
#
# ✅ failure() stays true for all following steps
#
# ❌ Steps without if: after a failure will be skipped by default
