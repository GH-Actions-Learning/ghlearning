# âœ… Short Answer How Step5 will execute:

# failure() doesnâ€™t just look at the immediately preceding step.
# It checks the entire job history up to that point for any failure (not skipped or allowed).
#
# So even if Step 4 succeeded, the job is still in a failed state because Step 3 failed,
# and that failure is still "active."
#
# ðŸ§  How failure() works:
# failure() returns true if any previous step in the job (not skipped or marked with continue-on-error) has failed.
#
# It is not reset by later successful steps.
#
# Once a step fails, failure() remains true for the rest of the job â€” unless you split things
