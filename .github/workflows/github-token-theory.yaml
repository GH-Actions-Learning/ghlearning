🔐 1. Introduction to GITHUB_TOKEN

The GITHUB_TOKEN is an auto-generated, temporary authentication token that GitHub creates for every workflow run.

You can use it to authenticate back to GitHub from within your GitHub Actions workflows — securely and without manually setting a secret.

The GITHUB_TOKEN is used to authenticate workflows to the GitHub API.

It allows workflows to perform actions such as creating pull requests, commenting, pushing code, and triggering other API-based operations.

The token ensures secure and scoped access for automation, limiting permissions to just what's necessary.

GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically generated and managed by GitHub for each workflow run, and generally preferred over using personal access tokens for most internal automation tasks.

***-------- "GITHUB_TOKEN is a minimal-privilege installation token issued by the built-in GitHub Actions App. 
It provides access to GitHub's REST/GraphQL API, scoped to the repository, and allows actions like pushing code, commenting, uploading artifacts, or fetching OIDC tokens. 
Its permissions are explicitly defined via the permissions: block in the workflow or enforced via repo/org-wide defaults."    ----------***

✅ Key Characteristics:

| Attribute                      | Details                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛡️ **Secure by default**      | Created per workflow run, scoped to the repository |
| ⏱️ **Short-lived**             | Expires automatically at the end of the workflow   |
| 🛠️ **Automatically injected** | No need to create it manually                      |
| 🔐 **Access-controlled**       | Only has permissions you allow (fine-grained)      |
| 🤖 **Bot identity**            | Represents `github-actions[bot]` user              |

| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 🔐 Secure           | ✅ Scoped, short-lived             | ❌ Long-lived, harder to manage |
| 🔄 Rotation         | ✅ Automatic                       | ❌ Manual                       |
| ⛓️ Scope            | ✅ Per workflow                    | ❌ Wide scope unless fine-tuned |
| 🛡️ Least privilege | ✅ Can be limited by `permissions` | ❌ Often over-privileged        |
| 🔁 Auto-generated   | ✅                                 | ❌ Needs manual creation        |

❓ 1. Why do we need GITHUB_TOKEN if GitHub Actions is native to GitHub?

Even though GitHub Actions is internal to GitHub, anything that interacts with GitHub's REST/GraphQL APIs or performs actions on behalf of a user or bot requires authentication.

GitHub Actions workflows are:

1. Automated CI/CD pipelines, yes.

2. But they are run in isolated runners (like virtual machines) that need explicit authorization to interact with GitHub's protected resources (repos, issues, PRs, releases, etc).

✅ Example Scenarios That Require Auth:

| Action                        | Why Token is Needed                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Create a PR or comment        | GitHub needs to know **who is performing the action** |
| Push code back to repo        | Requires write access                                 |
| Create a release              | Requires auth to GitHub API                           |
| Trigger another workflow      | GitHub checks if you have permission                  |
| Use GitHub API (`curl`, `gh`) | Auth header must be passed                            |

GitHub does not implicitly trust the runner. It needs the runner to prove it has the right to act — that's what the GITHUB_TOKEN does.

---
❓ 2. Where does GitHub generate the token from?

The token is generated by GitHub’s backend at the time your workflow starts running.

When you trigger a workflow (push, pull_request, etc.),

GitHub securely generates a temporary OAuth token scoped to:

1. The repository

2. The workflow run

3. The actor (who triggered the workflow)

GitHub then injects it into the runner's environment as: $GITHUB_TOKEN → available via secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN

It’s never stored permanently or shared across runs.

---
❓ 3. Who generates the token?

GitHub Actions infrastructure generates the token.

👷 Behind the Scenes:

GitHub (the platform, not your runner) is responsible for:

1. Authenticating the workflow request

2. Validating the trigger and actor

3. Generating a token based on repository + permissions

4. Injecting it securely into the workflow as secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN

The token belongs to a bot account named: github-actions[bot].

The token is automatically revoked after the workflow completes

It cannot be reused or extracted beyond the workflow

You can control its scope using the permissions: key

---
❓ 4) What does GITHUB_TOKEN contain to authenticate with GitHub API?

GITHUB_TOKEN is a temporary OAuth token — a string that carries scoped credentials issued by GitHub for the duration of a workflow run.

🔐 What's Inside?

Internally, it behaves just like any other OAuth bearer token (but it is:

Short-lived (valid only for this specific workflow run)

Scoped (tied to the repo)

Permission-controlled (via permissions: in workflow)

Issued by GitHub’s backend securely

| Metadata    | Meaning                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Issuer      | GitHub                                     |
| Owner       | `github-actions[bot]`                      |
| Scope       | The repo it was generated for              |
| Expiry      | Valid during this workflow run only        |
| Permissions | Defined by workflow's `permissions:` block |

GitHub checks:

1. Token is issued by GitHub

2. Token is valid (not expired)

3. Token scope matches target repo

4. Token has required permissions (read/write)

| ✅ 3. **GitHub Workflow**                                 | The logic/code that performs CI/CD or automation.                                                                      |                    |
| 🔄 4. **GitHub Runner**                                  | VM or container that actually executes the workflow steps (hosted or self-hosted). Token is injected here.             |                    |
| 🔑 5. **GitHub Actions Identity (github-actions\[bot])** | The actor identity that performs API calls using `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Shows up in logs, comments, git commits.              |                    |
| 🔐 6. **Workflow `permissions:` Block**                  | Controls what API access the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is allowed to have during the run.                                         |                    |

🔁 How They Work Together (Flow Summary)

1. Event triggers a workflow

2. GitHub backend validates the event

3. GitHub: Starts the runner

4. Generates a short-lived GITHUB_TOKEN

5. Injects token as secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN

6. The workflow runs on the runner

7. Any step calling GitHub API uses GITHUB_TOKEN in the Authorization header

8. GitHub API validates the token → checks repo, scope, permissions

9. ✅ If valid → performs the operation

---

GitHub hosts the GitHub API, which controls access to all core GitHub services. This is accurate and foundational to how GitHub operates.

Workflows are executed in runners (which act as clients). Each runner runs your workflow code in a virtual environment or container, representing a client interfacing with GitHub.

When these workflows need to perform operations on GitHub (like opening PRs, commenting, or pushing code), they must authenticate securely. This is true because all API interactions require authentication to ensure security and proper authorization.

This is achieved using the GITHUB_TOKEN, a short-lived, scoped token generated by GitHub and injected into the runner. The token is automatically created at the start of each workflow run and injected as an environment variable (secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN).

The workflow uses this token to authenticate to the GitHub API, which validates the token and permits only the allowed actions based on the token's permissions.

---
✅ What is a GitHub App?

A GitHub App is a first-class integration with GitHub, designed to interact with the GitHub API on behalf of users, repositories, or organizations — but with fine-grained permissions and secure authentication mechanisms.

🔧 Key features:

1. Installed on repositories or organizations

2. Has its own identity (app and bot)

3. Uses private keys + JWT tokens for authentication

4. Can issue installation tokens to perform GitHub operations

5. Scoped permissions (e.g., read-only PRs, write issues)

6. Webhooks for listening to GitHub events

✅ Real-world examples:

GitHub Actions itself is powered by a GitHub App (github-actions[bot])

Third-party tools like: Dependabot, Codecov, Slack integration, CI/CD tools like Jenkins or CircleCI are often GitHub Apps

---

🔗 What is the link between GitHub App and GITHUB_TOKEN?

The GITHUB_TOKEN that your GitHub Action workflows use is actually issued on behalf of a GitHub App — specifically the built-in github-actions GitHub App.

| Component                         | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub App (`github-actions`)** | Built-in GitHub App that powers GitHub Actions workflows                                          |
| **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**                | An **installation token** issued by the `github-actions` App                                      |
| **Token Identity**                | The token acts as **`github-actions[bot]`**                                                       |
| **Permissions**                   | Token's permissions are governed by the GitHub App’s installation + workflow `permissions:` block |
| **Lifetime**                      | The token is short-lived and scoped to the repo where the workflow runs                           |

---
    📌 Behind the Scenes
    
    When a workflow is triggered:
    
    1. GitHub detects the trigger event
    
    2. The GitHub Actions GitHub App is already installed on your repo
    
    3. GitHub generates a short-lived installation access token using the App’s credentials
    
    4. This token becomes the GITHUB_TOKEN you see in your workflow
    
    5. The token is scoped, permission-bound, and tied to the GitHub App
    
    6. The workflow (runner) uses this token to interact with the GitHub API as github-actions[bot]

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ | Create a new file inside the workflow without cloning repo | ❌ No                                                  | You’re not interacting with GitHub repo via API or git                      |
| 2️⃣ | Clone repo and generate artifact, but don’t push back      | ❌ No (unless cloning via HTTPS with auth)             | Read-only git operations don’t need `GITHUB_TOKEN` in GitHub-hosted runners |
| 3️⃣ | Push artifacts to external systems like Nexus/JFrog        | ❌ No (unless fetching from GitHub or tagging release) | `GITHUB_TOKEN` is only for GitHub API, not third-party systems              |

🔐 Permissions Model of GITHUB_TOKEN

| Level   | Meaning                                    |

-----------------------
✅ In GitHub Actions, permissions can be defined at two levels:

| Level                                                           | Scope                                                   | Purpose                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔝 Workflow-level (`permissions:` under `jobs:` or at the root) | Applies to **all jobs** in the workflow (default scope) | Set common or minimum permissions across the entire workflow |
| ⚙️ Job-level (`permissions:` inside a specific `job`)           | Applies to **only that job**                            | Override or restrict access on a per-job basis               |
