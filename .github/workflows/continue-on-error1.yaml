  # ✅ TEST 1
  test1:
    continue-on-error: true    # Job won't fail even if steps fail
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Risky step
        run: exit 1
        continue-on-error: true   # Step fails, but continues
      - name: Continue next step
        run: echo "✅ We reached here"  # ✅ Executes

    # 🔹 Output:
    # - Step 1 fails but is ignored.

  # ❌ TEST 2
  test2:
    continue-on-error: true    # Job marked success even if it fails
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Risky step
        run: exit 1
        continue-on-error: false   # Step fails and halts execution
      - name: Continue next step
        run: echo "✅ We reached here"  # ❌ Skipped

    # 🔹 Output:
    # - Step 1 fails, not ignored.

  # ❌ TEST 3
  test3:
    continue-on-error: true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Risky step
        run: exit 1
        continue-on-error: false   # Step fails, stops execution
      - name: Risky step
        run: exit 1
        continue-on-error: true    # ❌ Skipped
      - name: Continue next step
        run: echo "✅ We reached here"  # ❌ Skipped

    # 🔹 Output:

    # - Job status: ✅ SUCCESS (because of job-level continue-on-error)

  # ✅ TEST 4
  test4:
    continue-on-error: false   # Normal behavior: fail job on failure
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Risky step
        run: exit 1
        continue-on-error: true    # Step fails but is ignored
      - name: Continue next step
        run: echo "✅ We reached here"  # ✅ Executes

  # ❌ TEST 5
  test5:
    continue-on-error: false   # Default job behavior
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Risky step
        run: exit 1
        continue-on-error: false   # Step fails and halts job
