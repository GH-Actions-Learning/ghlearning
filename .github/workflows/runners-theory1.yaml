🧠 What Are GitHub-Hosted Runners?

GitHub-hosted runners are virtual machines (VMs) provisioned, managed, and maintained by GitHub, used to run your GitHub Actions jobs.
They are temporary and automatically created and destroyed per job.

📦 Pre-installed Software (Tool Cache)

Each GitHub-hosted runner comes with pre-installed tools like:

Node.js, Python, Java, .NET

Docker & Kubernetes tools

Azure CLI, AWS CLI, Terraform

Browsers: Chrome, Firefox

Xcode (on macOS)

Package managers: apt, pip, npm, Homebrew



🗂️ File System Layout

Each runner VM:

Has a clean working directory per job

Clones your repo into ~/actions-runner/_work/<repo>/<repo>

Deletes itself after the job ends

Cannot persist data between jobs or workflows (unless you use artifacts, cache, or actions/upload-artifact)


🔄 Lifecycle

Job is queued

GitHub allocates a VM

VM runs your job

VM is destroyed immediately after

How Self-Hosted Runners Work (Architecture)
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------

🧠 Overview

At a high level, self-hosted runners are machines that you provision, configure, and connect to GitHub, enabling them to execute GitHub Actions jobs locally.

Instead of using GitHub’s default (hosted) infrastructure, you bring your own compute — VM, physical machine, container, etc

-------

🔄 Lifecycle of a Self-hosted Runner

✅ Install Runner Agent

You download and configure the actions/runner binary on your machine.

🔒 Register with GitHub

Use a one-time registration token to connect it to a repo/org/enterprise.

🔁 Polls GitHub for Jobs

The runner polls GitHub’s servers every few seconds for new jobs (no incoming requests needed).

🏃 Job Execution

When a job is received, it:

Sets up a workspace

Runs each step of the job locally using the OS shell

Streams logs back to GitHub in real-time

🧹 Job Cleanup

After execution, it cleans up workspace and resets state (optional).

-----------

📦 Where Do You Install the Runner?

Self-hosted runners can be:

🖥️ Physical servers (common for CI in data centers)

🧱 Virtual machines (VMWare, Hyper-V, Azure, AWS, etc.)

📦 Containers (for isolated builds)

☁️ Cloud VMs (e.g. Azure VM Scale Sets with autoscaling)

----------

📬 Communication Model

Self-hosted runners do not open ports or require inbound traffic

They poll GitHub over HTTPS to check for new jobs

Traffic is always initiated by the runner, making it firewall-friendly

🔒 Security Architecture

All communication is TLS-encrypted

Jobs are executed as the user account that starts the runner

You can run the runner as a service with limited permissions

Environment isolation is your responsibility (unlike GitHub-hosted)

------------

🔄 Differences From GitHub-Hosted Runners

| Feature             | GitHub-Hosted       | Self-Hosted                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Infrastructure      | Managed by GitHub   | Managed by you                        |
| Environment Control | Limited             | Full                                  |
| Cost                | Pay per usage       | Free (but you pay for hardware/infra) |
| Scalability         | Auto-scaling        | You configure scaling                 |
| Persistence         | Ephemeral           | Persistent                            |
| Security            | Isolated by default | You must isolate workloads            |

🧩 Repo-Level vs Org-Level Runners

----

🔹 If you register a runner at the repository level:

✅ It only appears in that specific repository’s Settings → Actions → Runners.

🚫 It does not show up in the organization-wide runner list.

🚫 It cannot be used by other repositories in the same org.

----

🔹 If you register a runner at the organization level:

✅ It appears under Organization Settings → Actions → Runners.

✅ It can be shared across multiple repositories in the org.

You can scope it to:

All repos (default),

Or selected repos only.

└── runner.exe / run.sh     # Runner agent binaries


🔁 Execution Flow of a Job

Let’s walk through what happens when a workflow job is assigned to a self-hosted runner:

✅ Runner polls GitHub

Every few seconds via HTTPS

Finds a pending job matching its labels

📥 Receives job payload

Runner downloads the workflow, repo, secrets, etc.

🧱 Creates workspace directory

_work/<repo-name>/<job-id>/

📦 Runs each step

Steps are executed in a shell (bash, pwsh, etc.)

Default working directory is:

/actions-runner/_work/<repo-name>/<repo-name>

📤 Uploads artifacts (if any)

🧹 Job finishes

Workspace is NOT automatically deleted on self-hosted runners

---
⚠️ Self-Hosted Runner Workspace: Manual Cleanup Needed

| Runner Type   | Workspace Reset?                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| GitHub-hosted | ✅ Reset after each job           |
| Self-hosted   | ❌ Not reset unless you handle it |

---
📦 Tool Cache (_tool/)

If you use actions like setup-node, setup-python, etc., the runner stores the tools under:

/actions-runner/_tool/

This avoids redownloading tools across jobs.

You can prefill this cache to speed up builds.

---
📈 Logs & Diagnostics

Runner writes logs in:

/actions-runner/_diag/

These are runner-level logs, useful for:

1. Debugging runner connectivity

2. Job startup errors

3. Runner service failures

You can increase log verbosity for troubleshooting by setting environment variables like:

export RUNNER_TRACE=1

🧩 Job Isolation Summary

| Isolation Concern  | GitHub-Hosted | Self-Hosted    |
| ------------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| Workspace clean    | ✅ Always      | ❌ Manual       |
| Tool reuse         | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes          |
| Temp dir cleanup   | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No           |
| Artifact leftovers | ❌ Cleaned     | ✅ May remain   |
| Parallel jobs      | Isolated VMs  | Must configure |

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start     | `./svc.sh start` (Linux/macOS), `.\svc start` (Windows) |
| Stop      | `./svc.sh stop` / `.\svc stop`                          |
| Restart   | Stop + Start                                            |

Best Practices for Runner Security

| Practice                         | Why it matters                                |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Run as least-privileged user** | Prevents OS-level compromise                  |
| **Use dedicated user account**   | Isolates runner activity                      |
| **Don’t run as root/admin**      | Prevents full machine control                 |
| **Isolate by runner groups**     | Restricts access to trusted repositories only |
| **Clean up workspaces manually** | Avoid data leakage across jobs                |
| **Use ephemeral runners**        | Deletes runner instance after each job        |



---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------

Ephemeral & JIT (Just-In-Time) Runners

----------------------------------------

Ephemeral and JIT runners are advanced self-hosted runner configurations that improve security, scalability, and resource efficiency by creating runners that only exist for a single job — and then destroy themselves.

These are highly recommended for:

1. Running untrusted or sensitive code

2. Large-scale dynamic environments

3. Cloud-native or Kubernetes-based systems

4. Reducing risk of workspace leakage or tampering


---

🔹 1. What Are Ephemeral Runners?

Ephemeral runners are:

Short-lived: Spawned for a single workflow job

Clean: No persistent file system, secrets, or tools left behind

Disposable: Automatically removed after job completion

Ideal for secure and scalable CI/CD pipelines

They solve key problems:

1. Reduce risk of data leakage between jobs

2. Automatically scale based on demand

3. Avoid manual runner cleanup


---

🔹 2. What Are JIT (Just-In-Time) Runners?

JIT runners are a subset of ephemeral runners introduced in GitHub Actions with:

On-the-fly runner registration

GitHub provides a temporary registration token valid for one job

Runner auto-registers and executes the job, then de-registers and self-destructs

Useful for:

1. Dynamically spawning runners in the cloud

2. Autoscaling VMs or containers for each job

3. Integration with orchestration tools like Kubernetes or VM scale sets

------------------
Ephemeral Runners vs Persistent Runners
------------------

| Feature          | Ephemeral                    | Persistent                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Duration         | One job                      | Long-running                        |
| Cleanup          | Automatic                    | Manual or script-based              |
| Security         | Strong isolation             | Risk of leakage between jobs        |
| Scaling          | Can autoscale                | Requires static provisioning        |
| Use case         | Cloud-native, untrusted jobs | Trusted environments, limited scale |
| Setup complexity | Medium to High               | Low to Medium                       |

---
🔹 1. Ephemeral Basic Workflow:
---

1. GitHub requests a job execution

2. You dynamically spin up a runner VM/container

3. Runner registers using the ephemeral flag

4. Job runs

5. Runner self-destructs (deletes VM/container + deregisters)

./config.sh --url https://github.com/my-org/my-repo \
  --token <runner-token> \
  --ephemeral \
  --name my-ephemeral-runner

You can mark a self-hosted runner as ephemeral using:

./config.sh --ephemeral


---
🔹 1. JIT runners Basic Workflow:
---

JIT runners are ephemeral runners spun up programmatically when a job is queued, and removed upon completion.

✅ Option A: GitHub REST API (Custom Automation)

Use GitHub’s REST API to:

Register a runner with ephemeral: true

Poll workflow_job events and respond to queued, completed actions

After job completion, de-register the runner via API. 


✅ Option B: Using Actions Runner Controller (ARC) on Kubernetes

ARC is GitHub’s officially supported Kubernetes operator for managing self-hosted runners. 

It automates:

Scaling up by launching runner pods in Kubernetes when a workflow job is queued.

Each runner is ephemeral (“single-use”), registers with JIT token.

Upon job completion, ARC automatically deregisters & deletes the pod.


-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------
Autoscaling with ARC (Actions Runner Controller) & Kubernetes

-----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------

🔷 1. What is ARC (Actions Runner Controller)?

ARC (Actions Runner Controller) is the official GitHub-supported Kubernetes operator that:

1. Automates the management of self-hosted GitHub Actions runners in Kubernetes

2. Allows dynamic autoscaling — spins up and down runners per job

3. Supports both ephemeral and Just-In-Time (JIT) runners

4. Works with organization-level, enterprise-level, or repository-level runners

5. Offers full CI/CD scalability in the cloud

---
🔧 2. Key ARC Features

| Feature                 | Description                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Autoscaling             | Automatically adds/removes runner pods per job          |
| Ephemeral runners       | Runners that self-delete after job completion           |
| JIT runners             | Runners created **just-in-time** via GitHub webhook     |
| Multi-repo support      | Can isolate runners per repo, org, or enterprise        |
| Pod-based runners       | Each runner runs in its own Kubernetes pod              |
| Labels & selectors      | Route jobs to specific runners (e.g., `android`, `gpu`) |
| Resource limits         | Define CPU/memory for runner pods                       |
| Integration with GitHub | Securely authenticates with GitHub using GitHub App     |

---

📈 3. How Autoscaling Works

A workflow job is triggered on GitHub

GitHub sends a webhook to ARC

ARC uses GitHub App credentials to get a JIT registration token

ARC spins up a new ephemeral runner pod

The job runs inside the pod

Pod is deleted automatically after job completes

✔️ Scale-out happens per job
✔️ Scale-in is automatic (no idle runners)

---

⚙️ 6. Autoscaling Strategies

| Strategy                | Description                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scale-to-zero**       | No runners until a job is scheduled                |
| **Pod-per-job**         | One runner = one pod = one job                     |
| **Label-based scaling** | Use job labels to select specialized runner groups |
| **Job queue-based**     | Reacts to GitHub job queue in real-time            |

---------------------------------
---------------------------------

🔷 1. What Are Runner Groups?

---------------------------------

A runner group is a named collection of self-hosted runners used to logically group and manage runner access at the organization or enterprise level.

This allows you to:

1. Control which repositories can use which runners

2. Apply labels, isolate environments

3. Manage runners by project, department, platform, or security tier

---
🔑 2. Where Can You Use Runner Groups?

| Level            | Description                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Organization** | Group runners for a specific GitHub org   |
| **Enterprise**   | Group runners shared across multiple orgs |

---
⚙️ 3. Creating a Runner Group

🖥️ From the GitHub UI:

Settings → Actions → Runners → Runner Groups

1. Add a group

2. Define access: All repositories or Selected repositories only

3. Assign runners to this group

---
🧭 4. Access Control & Visibility

You can configure each runner group to:

1. Be used by all repositories in the organization (default)

2. Be restricted to specific repositories

3. Be restricted by teams (in future roadmap, currently not GA)

---
✅ How to Check Runner Labels

Go to:

GitHub → Your Org → Settings → Actions → Runners → Click your runner

See labels like:

self-hosted

linux

build

gpu

etc.
