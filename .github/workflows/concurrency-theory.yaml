What is Concurrency in GitHub Actions?

* Concurrency controls the number of workflow runs or jobs that can run simultaneously for a given concurrency group.

* It prevents race conditions, conflicts, or redundant runs when multiple triggers happen close together.

* Using concurrency, you can cancel in-progress runs of the same workflow or queue new runs until the previous ones complete.

*********

It simply checks:

  “Is there any other workflow run currently in progress with the same group name?”

  if yes, Then it will perform action or else it ignores.

*********

Why Use Concurrency?

* Avoid deploying multiple versions simultaneously to the same environment.

* Prevent overlapping builds that might cause inconsistent states or resource conflicts.

* Save compute resources by cancelling unnecessary runs.

* Manage workflow runs for the same branch, PR, or deployment target.

1) Problem Statements Without Concurrency

When you don’t use concurrency, GitHub Actions workflows triggered by the same event (e.g., multiple pushes to the same branch) can run simultaneously or overlap. This can cause several issues:

Problem 1:- Overlapping Workflow Runs Leading to Race Conditions

Example:-

You push code changes to the main branch three times within a minute. Without concurrency:

GitHub triggers 3 separate workflow runs for each push.

All 3 runs start and build your Flask app concurrently.

If your workflow deploys the app at the end, all 3 deploys run, possibly deploying conflicting versions.

The last run to finish may not be the last push, leading to an inconsistent or outdated deployment.

Output:-

Multiple deployment jobs start and finish.

You end up with an unpredictable final state of your app.

Waste of compute resources on builds/deploys for intermediate commits.

--------------

Problem 2:- Resource Contention and Inefficiency

Example:-

Your workflow runs resource-heavy jobs like building Docker images or integration tests.

Without concurrency control, multiple runs on the same branch compete for limited runners.

Parallel runs consume more CI minutes and slow down pipelines.

Unnecessary builds for intermediate commits slow down feedback to developers.

Output:-

Increased CI cost.

Slower overall pipeline due to runner queueing.

Developers waiting longer for test/deploy feedback.

-----------------

Problem 3:- Conflicts in Deployment or Shared State

Example:-

Your deployment step updates a Kubernetes cluster or a shared server.

Concurrent deploys can overwrite each other.

Partially applied deployments might cause downtime or inconsistency.

No clear guarantee that the last commit is the one actually deployed.

Output:-

Possible downtime or app errors.

Deployment logs show overlapping deploys.

Troubleshooting becomes complex.

--------------
Summary of Problems Without Concurrency

| Problem              | Cause                     | Effect                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Race conditions      | Multiple overlapping runs | Unpredictable app state        |
| Resource waste       | Redundant builds/deploys  | Higher costs, slower pipelines |
| Deployment conflicts | Concurrent deploys        | Downtime, broken app           |

-------------

2) How Does Concurrency Solve These Problems?

Concurrency groups define sets of workflow runs that cannot run simultaneously.

When a new run starts in the same concurrency group:

It cancels any in-progress runs (if cancel-in-progress: true).

Or queues the new run until the previous run completes.

This serializes workflow runs per group, ensuring no overlap.

The group name can be dynamic (branch, PR number, environment) to scope concurrency appropriately.

------

3) Detailed Examples Showing How Concurrency Works

Example 1: Cancel Previous Runs on Same Branch (Most Common Use Case)

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.ref }}   
  cancel-in-progress: true  

Scenario:

You push 3 commits quickly to main.

Workflow Run 1 starts immediately.

Workflow Run 2 triggered by second push starts → cancels Run 1.

Workflow Run 3 triggered by third push starts → cancels Run 2.

Finally, only Run 3 finishes.

Output:

Only one final build and deploy for the latest commit.

Saves resources and prevents race conditions.

Your deployed app is always from the latest commit.

-----------------

Example 2: Queue Runs Instead of Cancel (Set cancel-in-progress: false)

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: false

Scenario:

Push 3 commits rapidly to main.

Run 1 starts immediately.

Run 2 is queued and waits for Run 1 to finish.

Run 3 is queued behind Run 2.

Runs happen sequentially, not concurrently.

Output:

No cancellation; all runs complete in order.

More resource use but no race conditions.

Good if you want to preserve all runs (e.g., audit or logs).

-------------

Example 3: Concurrency per Pull Request (Use PR Number)

concurrency:
  group: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

Scenario:

Multiple pushes on the same PR trigger runs.

Only one workflow run for that PR runs at a time.

New pushes cancel the previous run on the same PR.

Output:

Prevents overlapping test runs on the same PR.

Saves resources and reduces confusing test results.

---------------------

Example 4: Concurrency per Deployment Environment

concurrency:
  group: deploy-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

Scenario:

Deploy jobs for the same branch use this concurrency group.

Ensures only one deployment at a time to the environment.

Prevents conflicting deploys from overlapping.

------

4) What Happens if You Don’t Use Concurrency?

Multiple workflow runs execute concurrently for same branch or PR.

Overlapping deployments or builds may cause issues.

Resource wastage, inconsistent results, race conditions.

Hard to know which run’s output is the final state.

5) Summary: How Concurrency Fixes These

| Feature              | How it Fixes the Problem                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `group`              | Defines scope of mutually exclusive runs (branch, PR, env) |
| `cancel-in-progress` | Stops outdated runs to save resources                      |
| Queuing runs         | Ensures sequential run order without overlap               |
| Dynamic groups       | Customize concurrency for different use cases (PRs, envs)  |

🔄 What Is a Concurrency Group in GitHub Actions?

A concurrency group is not something you create in the UI — it's just a label (string) that you define inside your workflow YAML under the concurrency key.

GitHub uses that string to identify and control how workflow runs are allowed to overlap (or not).

✅ Where to Define It?

You define the concurrency group inside your workflow file like this:

concurrency:
  group: your-custom-group-name
  cancel-in-progress: true

You can define it:

At the workflow level (applies to the whole workflow)

Or per job (to control concurrency for specific jobs like deploy)

--------

🎯 How to Create/Use a Concurrency Group

-------

🧩 Option 1: Static Group Name (not common)

concurrency:
  group: "only-one-run"
  cancel-in-progress: true

📌 This means: only one workflow run with group "only-one-run" can be active at a time, across all branches and PRs.

------

🧩 Option 2: Dynamic Group per Branch (common and useful)

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

📌 ${{ github.ref }} is like refs/heads/main or refs/pull/42/merge.

Use case: Only one run per branch at a time. If multiple pushes happen to main, only the latest one finishes.

------

🧩 Option 3: Scoped Group for Pull Requests

concurrency:
  group: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

📌 Ensures only one workflow run per PR number. Great for CI pipelines with lots of updates.

------

🧩 Option 4: Environment-Specific Deployment Groups

jobs:
  deploy-to-prod:
    concurrency:
      group: deploy-prod
      cancel-in-progress: true

📌 Ensures only one production deployment job runs at a time. Prevents race conditions during critical deploys.

-----

📝 Recap: You "create" concurrency groups by defining them in YAML

You don’t configure anything in the GitHub UI.

✅ Define concurrency like this in your workflow:

concurrency:
  group: my-deploy-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

GitHub interprets that as: "Only one workflow run in this group should be active."

------
1. What does this config do?

concurrency:
  group: br-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

Answer:
This groups runs by Git ref (e.g., refs/heads/main) and ensures only the most recent run per branch continues; in-progress ones are canceled.

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: br-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

Only the latest push to the same branch will run; previous runs are canceled.
------

2. What if another workflow lacks concurrency?

Answer:
Workflows without concurrency execute independently—they're not affected by other workflows' settings.

-----

3. Can workflows share a concurrency group?

Answer:
Yes—if two workflows use the same group name, newer runs in either workflow will cancel older runs in either workflow, provided both have cancel-in-progress: true.

-----

4. What do prefixes like pr-, test-, env- do?

Answer:
They’re purely cosmetic and help human readability. GitHub only compares the final resolved string of the group.

------

5. Using a completely arbitrary group name (e.g., banana-sundae)

Answer:
Allowed. If specified, multiple runs with the same group name cancel each other—even across branches or workflows.

Example:

concurrency:
  group: banana-sundae
  cancel-in-progress: true

-------

6. Does GitHub parse group names semantically?

Answer:
No. Grouping is based purely on string equality—there's no parsing of prefixes or semantic logic.

-------

7. Will main branch be handled by group: br-${{ github.ref }}?

Answer:
Yes—github.ref resolves to refs/heads/main, so the group string becomes br-refs/heads/main, and GitHub matches that exactly.

-------

8. Are workflows without concurrency unaffected?

Answer:
Yes—they run all instances regardless of other workflows' concurrency settings.

-------

9. How does GitHub evaluate concurrency groups?

Answer:
GitHub performs string-based matching at runtime. If a run triggers with a group that matches an in-progress run, the older run is canceled (with cancel-in-progress: true) or the new run is queued.

-------

10. Are group names case-insensitive and is ordering guaranteed?

Answer:
Group names are case-insensitive (e.g., prod and Prod considered identical). Ordering of run execution is not guaranteed and can occur in an arbitrary order.


-------------------------------------------
SCOPE OF CONCURRENCY
-------------------------------------------

| Scope Level    | Applied To          | Cancels Other Runs?  | Requires Same Group?  |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Workflow-level | Entire workflow run | Yes (global to repo) | Yes (same group name) |
| Job-level      | Individual job      | Yes (global to repo) | Yes (same group name) |
| Cross-workflow | Multiple workflows  | Yes (global to repo) | Yes (same group name) |

Workflow-level concurrency controls whether runs of that specific workflow can overlap. However, if the group name is shared, it will also cancel runs in any other workflows using the same group.

Job-level concurrency only affects the job itself, but if another workflow or job in the same repo uses the same group name, it will still cancel or block other runs globally.

The term “cross-workflow concurrency” isn’t explicitly in the docs—but the behavior is clear: any workflow or job in the same repository using the same concurrency group participates in the same global lock.
