âœ… Understanding How include Works in a GitHub Actions Matrix (Beginner Friendly)

-------------------------
If all matrix keys (like os and node) in the include match an existing matrix job, but the values are different:

ðŸ‘‰ A new job will be created using the new values from include.

Example:

Matrix has: os: ubuntu-latest, node: 18
Include has: os: ubuntu-latest, node: 19

â†’ A new job for node 19 will be added.

------------------------

If the include doesnâ€™t match any matrix keys at all (like os or node):

ðŸ‘‰ No job will be created, but the values in the include are still available to all jobs.

Example:

Include has: country: india (no os, no node)

â†’ No new job, but matrix.country is available inside every job.

-----------------------

If both the keys and values in the include exactly match an existing matrix job:

ðŸ‘‰ The job is already part of the matrix, so nothing happens â€” itâ€™s skipped.

Example:

Matrix has: os: ubuntu-latest, node: 14
Include has the same: os: ubuntu-latest, node: 14

â†’ Already exists â†’ skipped.

----------------------

If the include matches an existing matrix job, but adds extra values (new properties):

ðŸ‘‰ Those extra values are added (injected) into that job. The job is not duplicated, just enhanced.

Example:

Matrix has: os: ubuntu-latest, node: 18
Include adds: special: true

â†’ That job will run with special: true available inside.

--------------------

If only one matrix key matches in the include (like just os or just node):

ðŸ‘‰ GitHub will not create a new job, but any extra values in the include will be added to the matching base job.

Example:

Include: os: ubuntu-latest, testing: true

â†’ No new job is created, but testing: true will be added to all ubuntu-latest jobs.
